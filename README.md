# busCCo
BusCCo is a CRISPR-Cas mining pipeline designed for UNIX and Linux
operating systems. The pipeline accepts a nucleotide FASTA file
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format). Currently, the pipeline
is being built for individual bacterial or archaeal genomes,
but will later be usable with metagenomic
read data.

It's in the development stage so don't try anything yet.
